I'll add edit functionality to allow users to update items after they've been added. I'll modify the item detail modal to include an edit mode.

Now I need to add the styles for the new edit UI elements:

# Edit Functionality Added ✓

Users can now update items after they've been added. Here's what was implemented:

## Features Added:

1. **Edit Button** - Added an "Edit Item" button in the item detail modal
2. **Edit Mode** - When clicked, the modal switches to edit mode with:
   - Editable text fields for title, location, and value
   - Category selector with all available categories
   - Save Changes and Cancel buttons

3. **Update Function** - Items are updated in state and persisted to AsyncStorage

4. **Validation** - Title is required before saving changes

## How It Works:

1. Tap an item to open the detail modal
2. Click the "Edit Item" button
3. Modify the title, category, location, or value
4. Click "Save Changes" to update or "Cancel" to discard changes
5. The item list automatically updates with the new information

The edit form includes all categories (including custom ones) and uses the same decimal-pad keyboard for the value field.
