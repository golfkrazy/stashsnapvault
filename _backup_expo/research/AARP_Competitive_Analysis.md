## AARP Digital Vault - Complete Feature Set

### 1. Document Management (❌ Missing in StashSnap)

#### What They Offer:
- **Legal Documents:** Wills, trusts, powers of attorney, living wills

---

### 2. Secure Sharing with Trusted Contacts (❌ Missing in StashSnap)

#### What They Offer:
- **Granular Permissions:** Assign specific access levels to different people
