# Part 1: Research
Research five customer avatars for an offer about [a discreet inventory app StashSnap]. The avatars will be based off of the Stages of Market Awareness as taught by Eugene Schwartz in his book Breakthrough Advertising. I want one avatar for each stage:

These stages are:

- Unaware

- Product Aware
- Most Aware

The audience is [older adults and their caregivers to ] [It solves the common problem of memory lapses related to stashed items—like passports, emergency cash, or heirlooms]

It’s a [0.99 price point] [offer] that helps [older adults and their caregivers] [help track and retrieve valuables and important documents often hidden around the home and later forgotten]
