Content Guidelines for B2B Tone
Voice & Tone
Professional but approachable: Avoid overly casual language, but don't be stuffy
Confident, not arrogant: Assert value without overselling
Clear and concise: Respect the reader's time, get to the point
Benefit-focused: Always tie features to business outcomes
Data-driven: Use statistics and proof points where possible
Copywriting Principles
Lead with benefits, not features: "Close deals 40% faster" before "AI-powered lead scoring"
Use specific numbers: "Save 10 hours per week" not "save time"
Address objections preemptively: Security, integration, ROI concerns
Use power words: Transform, accelerate, eliminate, automate, optimize, streamline
Avoid jargon: Unless it's industry-standard terminology your audience knows
Show, don't tell: Use case studies and concrete examples
Create urgency authentically: Focus on opportunity cost, not false scarcity
Example Copy Snippets
Hero Headline Examples:

"Turn Your Sales Team Into a Revenue-Generating Machine"
"Stop Guessing Which Leads Will Close—Know with 95% Accuracy"
"Cut Your Sales Cycle in Half with AI-Powered Intelligence"
Feature Description Example: "Predictive Lead Scoring: Stop wasting time on leads that won't convert. Our AI analyzes 50+ behavioral signals to rank every prospect by likelihood to close, so your team focuses only on opportunities that matter. The result? Win rates increase by an average of 40% within the first quarter."

"Schedule Your Free Demo" (not just "Demo")

"Start Your 30-Day Trial" (not just "Sign Up")
