I'll read all files in your docs/ folder to understand the business concept, brand, and landing page requirements.

# Understanding of StashSnap

Based on the documentation in your docs/ folder, here's what I understand:

## Business Concept

**StashSnap** is a discreet inventory app designed to solve a critical problem for older adults and their caregivers: memory lapses related to stashed items like passports, emergency cash, heirlooms, and important documents that are hidden around the home and later forgotten.

### Core Problem
- Older adults often put valuable items in "safe places" and then forget where they are
- This creates emotional distress, time-consuming searches, and potential legal/financial problems
- Caregivers (typically adult children) spend hours searching through homes, experiencing frustration, guilt, and exhaustion

### Solution
A simple mobile app ($0.99 price point) that allows users to:
- Take photos of items and their hiding locations
- Add descriptions and location details
- Search and retrieve this information instantly when needed

### Target Audience
**Primary Avatar: Carol Peterson** (Problem-Aware Caregiver)
- 54-year-old woman caring for aging mother
- Part-time administrative assistant, married, middle-class ($75k household income)
- Overwhelmed by caregiving duties while managing her own life
- Experiences constant anxiety about lost items and their consequences
- Values family, responsibility, financial prudence, and tradition

## Brand Identity

### Brand Essence
- **Simplicity**: Easy to use, no learning curve
- **Relief**: Provides peace of mind and reduces anxiety
- **Control**: Empowers caregivers to manage chaos
- **Compassion**: Understanding of the emotional burden
- **Trust**: Reliable solution for critical needs

### Brand Voice
- **Tone**: Warm, reassuring, empathetic but professional
- **Language**: Clear, jargon-free, emotionally intelligent
- **Style**: Benefit-focused, addressing real pain points with genuine understanding

### Brand Narrative
StashSnap understands the invisible burden carried by caregivers of aging parents—the 2 AM anxiety, the frantic searches, the guilt. For less than a dollar, this simple app transforms chaos into control by creating a visual inventory of stashed items. It's not just about finding things; it's about reclaiming peace of mind and preserving the dignity of both caregiver and loved one.

## Landing Page Requirements

### Key Differences from PRD
The PRD in your docs folder is for a **B2B SaaS platform** (AI-powered sales intelligence), which is **NOT** your product. Your actual product is **StashSnap** (B2C mobile app for caregivers). The landing page should focus on:

### Recommended Landing Page Structure

1. **Hero Section**
   - Headline addressing emotional pain: "Finally, Remember Where Mom Put Everything"
   - Subheadline: Peace of mind for 99 cents
   - Visual: App screenshot showing simple interface with photo of item
   - CTA: "Download Now" (iOS/Android)

2. **Problem Section**
   - Relatable scenarios from Carol's diary
   - "The deed in the shoebox. The passport in the freezer. The cash in the National Geographic."
   - Statistics on caregiver stress and time spent searching

3. **Solution Section**
   - Three-step process: Snap → Describe → Find
   - Visual demonstration of app workflow
   - Emphasis on simplicity (big + button, clear photos)

4. **Emotional Transformation**
   - Before/After narrative (based on Carol's diary entries)
   - From anxiety and exhaustion to relief and control
   - Testimonial-style story

5. **Features**
   - Photo documentation (location + close-up)
   - Search functionality
   - Simple categorization
   - Privacy/security (local storage)

6. **Trust Signals**
   - AARP mention (from diary)
   - Caregiver community endorsements
   - Privacy assurance
   - Money-back guarantee

7. **Pricing**
   - One-time $0.99 purchase
   - No subscription, no hidden fees
   - Comparison to cost of one coffee vs. hours of peace

8. **Final CTA**
   - "Give Yourself the Gift of Peace of Mind"
   - App store buttons
   - Risk-free messaging

### Design Considerations
- **Mobile-first**: Primary use case is on phones
- **Large, clear typography**: Accessible for older users
- **Warm, calming colors**: Not corporate/cold
- **Real photos**: Not stock imagery—authentic scenarios
- **Emotional connection**: Lead with empathy, not features

The brand document template you have is excellent but needs to be populated with StashSnap-specific content rather than B2B SaaS content.
